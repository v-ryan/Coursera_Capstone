    "Bandung is the capital city of West Java - Indonesia. In the early 20th century the Dutch inhabitants of Bandung demanded the establishment of a municipality (gemeente), which was granted in 1906, and Bandung gradually developed into a resort city for plantation owners. Luxurious hotels, restaurants, caf√©s, and European boutiques were opened, leading the city to be nicknamed Parijs van Java (Dutch: \"The Paris of Java\") (Ref. Wikipedia).<br>\n",
